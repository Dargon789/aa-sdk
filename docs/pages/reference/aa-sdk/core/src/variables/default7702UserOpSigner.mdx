description: Provides a default middleware function for signing user operations with a client account when using EIP-7702 delegated accounts. If the signer doesn't support `signAuthorization`, then this just runs the provided `signUserOperation` middleware. This function is only compatible with accounts using EntryPoint v0.7.0, and the account must have an implementation address defined in `getImplementationAddress()`.

```

Defined in: [aa-sdk/core/src/middleware/defaults/7702signer.ts:18](https://github.com/alchemyplatform/aa-sdk/blob/17aad1f572375d42a06c7e3238078a88a435d459/aa-sdk/core/src/middleware/defaults/7702signer.ts#L18)

Provides a default middleware function for signing user operations with a client account when using EIP-7702 delegated accounts.
If the signer doesn't support `signAuthorization`, then this just runs the provided `signUserOperation` middleware.
This function is only compatible with accounts using EntryPoint v0.7.0, and the account must have an implementation address defined in `getImplementationAddress()`.

## Deprecated

The EIP-7702 auth signature is now handled by the defaultUserOpSigner middleware. This middleware is no longer necessary.

## Returns

`ClientMiddlewareFn`
